Abstract: AI chatbots shook the world not long ago with their potential to revolutionize education systems in a myriad of ways. AI chatbots can provide immediate support by answering questions, offering explanations, and providing additional resources. Chatbots can also act as virtual teaching assistants, supporting educators through various means. In this paper, we try to understand the full benefits of AI chatbots in education, their opportunities, challenges, potential limitations, concerns, and prospects of using AI chatbots in educational settings. We conducted an extensive search across various academic databases, and after applying specific predefined criteria, we selected a final set of 67 relevant studies for review. The research findings emphasize the numerous benefits of integrating AI chatbots in education, as seen from both students’ and educators’ perspectives. We found that students primarily gain from AI-powered chatbots in three key areas: homework and study assistance, a personalized learning experience, and the development of various skills. For educators, the main advantages are the time-saving assistance and improved pedagogy. However, our research also emphasizes significant challenges and critical factors that educators need to handle diligently. These include concerns related to AI applications such as reliability, accuracy, and ethical considerations.

Journal: International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education","Title: AI student success predictor: Enhancing personalized learning in campus management systems
Abstract: Campus Management Systems (CMSs) are vital tools in managing educational institutions, handling tasks like student enrollment, scheduling, and resource allocation. The increasing adoption of CMS for online and mixed-learning environments highlights their importance. However, inherent limitations in conventional CMS platforms hinder personalized student guidance and effective identification of academic challenges. Addressing this crucial gap, our study introduces an AI Student Success Predictor empowered by advanced machine learning algorithms, capable of automating grading processes, predicting student risks, and forecasting retention or dropout outcomes. Central to our approach is the creation of a standardized dataset, meticulously curated by integrating student information from diverse relational databases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature learning block is developed to extract the hidden patterns in the student data. This classification model stands as an ensemble masterpiece, incorporating SVM, Random Forest, and KNN classifiers, subsequently refined by a Bayesian averaging model. The proposed ensemble model shows the ability to predict the student grades, retention, and risk levels of dropout. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model is assessed using test data, culminating in a commendable 93% accuracy for student grade prediction and student risk prediction, and a solid 92% accuracy for the complex domain of retention and dropout forecasting. The proposed AI system seamlessly integrates with existing CMS infrastructure, enabling real-time data retrieval and swift, accurate predictions, enhancing academic decision-making efficiency. Our study’s pioneering AI Student Success Predictor bridges the chasm between traditional CMS limitations and the growing demands of modern education.

Abstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

Journal: 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems","Title: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
Abstract: We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).

Journal: NAACL-HLT","Title: ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract: We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.

Abstract: We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.

Abstract: Modeling the distribution of natural images is a landmark problem in unsupervised learning. This task requires an image model that is at once expressive, tractable and scalable. We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast twodimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset. Samples generated from the model appear crisp, varied and globally coherent.

Abstract: Theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that the depth of neural networks is crucial for their success. However, training becomes more difficult as depth increases, and training of very deep networks remains an open problem. Here we introduce a new architecture designed to overcome this. Our so-called highway networks allow unimpeded information flow across many layers on information highways. They are inspired by Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks and use adaptive gating units to regulate the information flow. Even with hundreds of layers, highway networks can be trained directly through simple gradient descent. This enables the study of extremely deep and efficient architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) neural network architecture for image generation. DRAW networks combine a novel spatial attention mechanism that mimics the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential variational auto-encoding framework that allows for the iterative construction of complex images. The system substantially improves on the state of the art for generative models on MNIST, and, when trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset, it generates images that cannot be distinguished from real data with the naked eye.

Journal: Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning","Title: Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled: High Confidence Predictions for Unrecognizable Images
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed that changing an image (e.g., of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g., mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g., labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call ""fooling images"" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.

Abstract: We evaluate whether features extracted from the activation of a deep convolutional network trained in a fully supervised fashion on a large, fixed set of object recognition tasks can be repurposed to novel generic tasks. Our generic tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks. We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges. We compare the efficacy of relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges. We are releasing DeCAF, an open-source implementation of these deep convolutional activation features, along with all associated network parameters to enable vision researchers to be able to conduct experimentation with deep representations across a range of visual concept learning paradigms.

Abstract: New product innovation has long been a key avenue for revenue and profit growth, especially in industries such as life sciences and high technology. With lifetimes of products shrinking, technical complexity increasing, and daunting odds of success a norm, firms are forced to invest continually and ever-growing amounts to maintain their competitive edge. In response, some firms have looked beyond their four walls to manage the costs and risks of new product development (Quinn 2000). Pharmaceutical companies increasingly turn to each other and partner with specialist firms to develop new compounds that cost nearly a billion dollars to launch (Grover 1998). Articles trace HP’s development of its highly profitable printer business to joint work with suppliers during different phases of its business. Even companies with a strong patent portfolio and research budgets such as IBM have begun forging joint-development agreements to meet the challenges of contemporary products and markets (Austin American Statesman 2003). The increasing uncertainty, complexity of knowhow, and costs of product development and distribution require firms to pool their resources and enter into joint-development contracts involving the sharing of product revenues, development costs, and research and development (R&D) effort between industrial customers and suppliers, which forms the focus of this paper. Although intercompany alliance issues such as the melding of cultures have received a fair amount of research attention in the strategic management and organizational behavior literature (reviewed in the next section), the operational challenges of joint development are equally complex but relatively understudied. Unlike manufacturing and assembly, where activities can sometimes be outsourced in an arms-length transfer of prices and quantities, product development is an uncertain and long-lead-time activity with advance investments and joint work between firms that requires coordination about product features and qualities. In consolidating and converging industries such as high technology, firms may also fear that their partners may appropriate a large portion of the benefits. The classic product development challenges of managing technology and market uncertainty are coupled with agency issues stemming from opportunistic behavior of development partners. In this paper, we focus on a specific form of joint development between two firms that consider sharing the product revenues, development costs, and development effort. The product being developed is based on an uncertain underlying technology/science, and the firms could differ in their development capabilities as well as their power in the value chain. We now discuss the nuances of joint development in two of the industries that we studied.

Journal: Management Science","Title: Conceptualizing smart service systems
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of physical products that are digitally networked with other products and with information systems to enable complex business scenarios in manufacturing, mobility, or healthcare. These “smart products”, which enable the co-creation of “smart service” that is based on monitoring, optimization, remote control, and autonomous adaptation of products, profoundly transform service systems into what we call “smart service systems”. In a multi-method study that includes conceptual research and qualitative data from in-depth interviews, we conceptualize “smart service” and “smart service systems” based on using smart products as boundary objects that integrate service consumers’ and service providers’ resources and activities. Smart products allow both actors to retrieve and to analyze aggregated field evidence and to adapt service systems based on contextual data. We discuss the implications that the introduction of smart service systems have for foundational concepts of service science and conclude that smart service systems are characterized by technology-mediated, continuous, and routinized interactions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered service innovation (e.g., OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Sydney) has become one of the most significant determinants of firms’ success in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, extant studies on this topic show that research studies hitherto have been ad-hoc, lacking a conceptual framework for the strategic management of AI-powered service innovation capability in dynamic markets. Thus, this study synthesises the current body of knowledge, proposes a framework, and develops an agenda to advance our knowledge. The findings reveal: (1) AI-market capability relates to customer orientation, industry orientation, and cross-functional orientation; (2) AI-infrastructure capability relates to data, business models, and ecosystem; and (3) AI-management capability relates to AI-orientation, organisational learning, and AI ethics which are crucial determinants of forming AI-powered service innovation capability. These capabilities for the strategic management of AI-powered service innovations play an essential role in achieving organizational agility and competitive advantage.

    Abstract:In the rapidly advancing era of educational technology, customized learning materials have the potentialto enhance individuals’ learning capacities. This research endeavors to devise an effective method fordetecting a learner’s preferred learning style and subsequently adapting the learning content to align withthat style, utilizing artificial intelligence AI techniques. Our investigation finds that analyzing learners’ webtracking logs for activity classification and categorizing individual responses for feedback classification arehighly effective methods for identifying a learner’s learning styles, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.A custom dataset has been constructed in this research comprising approximately 506 samples and 22features utilizing the Moodle learning management system (LMS), successfully categorizing students intotheir respective learning styles. Furthermore, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM),logistic regression, XGBoost, blending ensemble, and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms withcorresponding optimized hyperparameters and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) have beenapplied for learning behavior classification. The blending ensemble technique with the XGBoost meta-learningmodel accomplished the best performance for learning style detection with an accuracy of 97.56%. Next, thetext content of the electronic documents is modified by employing different natural language processing (NLP)techniques, including named entity recognition of spaCy, knowledge graph, generative pre-trained transformer3 (GPT-3), and text-to-text transfer transformer (T5) model, to accommodate diverse learning styles. Variousapproaches, such as color coding, audio scripts, mind maps, flashcards, etc., are implemented to adapt thecontent effectively for the detected categories of learners. The spaCy NLP-based named entity recognition(NER) model demonstrates a 94.16% F1 score and 0.92 exact match ratio for color coding text generation often electronic documents comprising 790 distinct individual words. These modifications aim to cater to theunique preferences of learners, fostering a more personalized and engaging educational experience. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first time an integrated learning style detection and content modification systemhas been developed in this work utilizing efficient AI techniques and a private dataset.

Abstract: It is essential to utilize deep-learning algorithms based on big data for the implementation of the new generation of artificial intelligence. Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set. Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples. Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness. This research is also expected to contribute to the comprehensive promotion of new-generation artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.

Journal: COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM","Title: A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style
Abstract: In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition, near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.
Keywords: Artistic Style, Neural Algorithm, Deep Neural Networks","Title: Attention Is All You Need
Abstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.
